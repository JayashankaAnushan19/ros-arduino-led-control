# <u>ROS Arduino LED Control</u>

In this project i am going to communicate between simple ROS program with Arduino Uno board and light a LED. Below is the inialization and configuration steps.

## Install Arduino
For install arduino need to run below code.

```sudo apt install arduino```

This will install Arduino and below code can use to check the version

```arduino --version```

If got any error regarding 'dialout', install below library.

```sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module```

run arduino using below code or by search icon via application menu;

```arduino```

## Arduino programming
### <u>[First Try](First_Try.md)</u>
Included all the details about how started this project and firstly connection establishment with start to communicate with Arduino Uno board.

### <u>[Second Try](Second_Try.md)</u>
This is about send message from ROS to Arduino board and then get the response from arduino board to ROS.

## Conclusion
In this project, I utilized VMware Workstation 16 to create a virtualized Ubuntu environment on a Windows host machine. Due to this setup, there may be slight communication delays; however, when properly configured, the connection between the host and virtual machine operates seamlessly. For visual representation, I used both the built-in LED and an external LED to establish a clear indication of system activity.

## Future enhancement
Future improvements could include enabling communication with different types of data and integrating more advanced modules to execute complex tasks efficiently. Expanding the projectâ€™s capabilities will allow for broader applications and increased functionality.
